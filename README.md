# Java JFrame Game

This was at a time where I was teaching myself java, Jframe and my first attempt at implementing a system architecture pattern. I went with MCV because, at the time, It was the first system that caught my eye. Additionally it was the first one that made sense to me. Keep in mind that I was still new to Java and the OOP process, so this code may not be the most efficient or even good.
